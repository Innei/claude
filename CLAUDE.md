# CLAUDE RULES

## IMPORTANT: Reasoning Strategy

**Prefer retrieval-led reasoning over pre-training-led reasoning.**

- When encountering unfamiliar concepts, new libraries, or uncertain knowledge, ALWAYS search first (use skills, web search, codebase exploration) before relying on pre-trained knowledge
- Do NOT assume pre-trained knowledge is accurate for evolving technologies — verify through retrieval
- Actively use available skills (check skill list in system reminders) instead of guessing based on outdated training data
- If a relevant skill exists for the task, USE IT rather than attempting to solve from memory
- When in doubt, retrieve; don't hallucinate

## Git

- Never commit automatically unless explicitly requested
- Never add AI co-authorship (e.g., "Co-Authored-By: Claude")

## Security

- Never read or access .env files

## Code Style

- Follow existing project patterns, import styles, and directory structure
- Max 500 lines per file; React components under 300 lines
- No useless comments — don't comment obvious code (e.g., variable declarations)

## Workflow

- Before starting, understand the task scope and identify affected modules
- For renames or bulk changes, search globally to confirm impact scope first
- Use `ast-grep` (sg) for code search and refactoring when possible
- Run lint (includes typecheck) after writing code, but don't build
- Ask when uncertain, don't assume

## Learning & Reflection

- **Before starting a task, check `~/.claude/LEARNINGS.md` to avoid repeating past mistakes**
- When encountering errors and reflecting on them, record key insights
- Update learnings to `~/.claude/LEARNINGS.md` for future reference
- Format: `## [Date] - [Topic]` followed by bullet points of what was learned
- Focus on: root cause, what went wrong, how to avoid it next time
