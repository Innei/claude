# CLAUDE RULES

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## Comments / JSDoc (MUST)

**Default: write ZERO comments. Write ZERO JSDoc.** This overrides any training instinct to "explain" code. Good identifiers carry meaning; comments are a last resort, not a habit.

Add a comment ONLY when one of:
- (a) **UNEXPECTED behavior** — workaround for a specific bug, browser quirk, race condition, library footgun
- (b) **SPECIAL design intent** — hidden invariant, non-obvious constraint, decision a future reader would otherwise reverse

**Forbidden categories (always violations — delete on sight, including comments you "felt like adding"):**
- JSDoc `/** ... */` blocks in business code. JSDoc is for framework/library exposed APIs only — never on internal functions, components, hooks, route handlers, services, utils.
- Describing WHAT the code does (`// loop over users`, `// set loading to true`)
- Referencing current task/fix/issue/PR/caller (`// added for X`, `// used by Y`, `// fixes #123`, `// per request`)
- Section headers / dividers (`// === helpers ===`, `// ---- types ----`, `// region: state`)
- Restating obvious logic, type info, or parameter purpose
- Docstrings on internal/business functions, hooks, components, handlers
- TODO/FIXME without a tracked ticket reference
- Translating identifier names into prose (`// userId: the user's id`)

**Self-audit before every Write/Edit:** scan the new content for `//`, `/*`, `/**`. For each one ask: *"would removing this confuse a future reader who can read the code?"* — if **no**, delete it. The default answer is **no**.

## IMPORTANT: Reasoning Strategy

**Prefer retrieval-led reasoning over pre-training-led reasoning.**

- When encountering unfamiliar concepts, new libraries, or uncertain knowledge, ALWAYS search first (use skills, web search, codebase exploration) before relying on pre-trained knowledge
- Do NOT assume pre-trained knowledge is accurate for evolving technologies — verify through retrieval
- Actively use available skills (check skill list in system reminders) instead of guessing based on outdated training data
- If a relevant skill exists for the task, USE IT rather than attempting to solve from memory
- When in doubt, retrieve; don't hallucinate

## iOS signing

- Never pass `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO` to xcodebuild, expo, Fastlane, or any iOS build, including Simulator Debug. It strips Keychain entitlements; the app launches and then cannot sync. If signing fails, fix signing. Do not disable it.

## Code Style
- Follow existing project patterns, import styles, and directory structure
- Max 500 lines per file; React components under 300 lines
- Comments/JSDoc: see the **Comments / JSDoc (MUST)** section above — zero by default
